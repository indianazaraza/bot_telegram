# README.md
Dominiosregistrados_bot is connected to the Domainsdb api. 

You can check the documentation [here](https://api.domainsdb.info/v1/#/). Or
you can also search for a domain and see the results on its [page](https://domainsdb.info/).

It uses the following commands: help, info, search, and welcome. Help will give you a brief description of what each command does.
When doing a domain search, the bot will return the number of internet domains that are active and inactive, and some that exist as an example.


If it does not find an existing domain it will send a message. As if the search command is invoked without a domain.
